# CS5342 Final Project
<br>

Data & output folders have been excluded, they are TOO BIG.
datasets used is mipsnerf360 & tanks and temples. 

The exact instructions to run would be too long for me to type out and for no one to read.
If actually interested, please let me know. If not please trust that it works.

Steps
1. Render with RAIN-GS
2. Prune with LG
3. Compress with C3DGS
4. Run with SA
